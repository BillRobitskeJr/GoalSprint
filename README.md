# GoalSprint: Reach your goals in a hurry

It is hard to reach activity goals.  They either seem too lofty, are too easy to fall behind on, or lack any real incentive to keep making progress.  GoalSprint will (1) help break goals into more manageable bits, (2) make it easy to catch up after the occasional "off day", and (3) help encourage making daily progress towards a goal.
